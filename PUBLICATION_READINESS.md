## üîí Security Assessment

### ‚úÖ SECURE ITEMS
1. **API Key Management**
   - Google Maps API key properly stored in `local.properties` (gitignored)
   - No hardcoded secrets in the codebase
   - API key loaded at build time via Gradle

2. **Network Security**
   - All data fetched via HTTPS only
   - DataService enforces HTTPS protocol validation
   - Proper timeout and error handling for network requests

3. **Data Privacy**
   - No user personal data collection
   - No analytics or tracking libraries installed
   - Minimal permissions (Internet only)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY CONCERNS TO ADDRESS

1. **Release Signing**
   - Currently using debug keystore for release builds
   - **ACTION REQUIRED**: Generate production keystore before publication

2. **ProGuard/R8 Configuration**
   - Code obfuscation currently disabled
   - **ACTION REQUIRED**: Enable and configure for production

3. **Certificate Pinning**
   - No certificate pinning for API endpoints
   - **RECOMMENDED**: Add certificate pinning for GitHub Pages API

## üì± App Permissions & Privacy

### Current Permissions
- `android.permission.INTERNET` - Required for fetching wildfire data

### Privacy Considerations
- **Data Sources**: Government public data (CWFIS, Environment Canada)
- **User Location**: Not collected or tracked
- **User Data**: None collected
- **Third-party Services**: Google Maps (for map display only)

### **ACTION REQUIRED**: Create Privacy Policy covering:

## ‚ö° Performance & Optimization

### Current State
- **Bundle Size**: Moderate (React Native + Maps)
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized with memoization
- **Refresh Rate**: 30-minute data cache
- **Offline Support**: Basic (AsyncStorage caching)

### Optimizations Implemented
- React.memo for heavy components
- useCallback/useMemo for render optimization
- Marker rendering optimization (tracksViewChanges=false)
- Data caching and rate limiting

### **RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS**:
1. Enable Hermes for better performance (already configured)
2. Implement code splitting for lazy loading
3. Optimize image assets (if adding app icons/splash)
4. Consider ProGuard rules for smaller APK

cd android/app
keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore boreal-smoke-release.keystore -alias boreal-smoke-key -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

### Configure Release Signing (android/app/build.gradle)
```gradle
signingConfigs {
    release {
        storeFile file('boreal-smoke-release.keystore')
        storePassword 'YOUR_STORE_PASSWORD'
        keyAlias 'boreal-smoke-key'
        keyPassword 'YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD'
    }
}
```

### Build Release APK
```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

### Build Release Bundle (AAB) for Play Store
```bash
cd android
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

## üîç Current Issues to Fix

### HIGH PRIORITY
1. **No production keystore** - Using debug key for release
2. **Missing app icons** - Using default React Native icons
3. **No privacy policy** - Required for Play Store
4. **Missing attribution** - Required by data licenses

### MEDIUM PRIORITY
1. **No crash reporting** - Difficult to debug production issues
2. **Limited offline support** - Could improve user experience
3. **No update mechanism** - Users won't know about new versions

### LOW PRIORITY
1. **No analytics** - Can't track usage patterns
2. **English only** - Limits Canadian market reach
3. **Basic UI** - Could enhance visual appeal

---

## üìå Final Recommendations

1. **Start with Android** - Simpler publication process
2. **Use Google Play's Internal Testing** - Test with real users before public release
3. **Plan for Updates** - Set up CI/CD for easier updates
4. **Monitor Reviews** - Respond to user feedback quickly
5. **Consider Beta Program** - Get early feedback from power users

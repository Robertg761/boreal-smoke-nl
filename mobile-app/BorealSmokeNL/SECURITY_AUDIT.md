# Security and Code Audit Report
## NL Wildfire Tracker v1.1.0-alpha
**Date:** August 16, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security and code review was conducted on both frontend and backend components of the NL Wildfire Tracker application. While the application follows many best practices, several critical and moderate security issues were identified that should be addressed before production deployment.

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES

### 1. **Exposed Google Maps API Key**
- **Location:** `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` (line 17)
- **Risk:** The Google Maps API key is hardcoded and exposed in the repository
- **Impact:** Potential for API quota theft, unauthorized usage, and financial costs
- **Solution:** 
  ```xml
  <!-- Use BuildConfig or environment variables -->
  android:value="@string/google_maps_key"
  ```
  - Store API key in local.properties or use environment variables
  - Add API key restrictions in Google Cloud Console (bundle ID, SHA-1 fingerprint)
  - Rotate the exposed key immediately

### 2. **Exposed File System Paths in Metadata**
- **Location:** GitHub Pages metadata.json
- **Risk:** Full local file paths are exposed publicly
- **Impact:** Information disclosure about development environment
- **Example:** `"G:\\Projects\\NL-Wildfire-Air-Quality-Tracker\\temp_data\\data.json"`
- **Solution:** Use relative paths or sanitize metadata before publishing

### 3. **Hardcoded Git Path**
- **Location:** `backend/update_data.py` (line 30)
- **Risk:** Windows-specific hardcoded git path
- **Impact:** Script failure on other systems, potential path traversal
- **Solution:**
  ```python
  import shutil
  self.git_path = shutil.which('git') or 'git'
  ```

---

## 🟡 MODERATE ISSUES

### 4. **No Input Validation for Coordinates**
- **Location:** Backend wildfire processing
- **Risk:** Potential for malformed data to crash the app
- **Solution:** Add coordinate validation:
  ```python
  def validate_coordinates(lat, lon):
      if not (-90 <= lat <= 90 and -180 <= lon <= 180):
          raise ValueError(f"Invalid coordinates: {lat}, {lon}")
  ```

### 5. **Missing Rate Limiting**
- **Location:** DataService.js
- **Risk:** Potential for API abuse or self-DoS
- **Solution:** Implement rate limiting:
  ```javascript
  const rateLimiter = {
    lastCall: 0,
    minInterval: 5000, // 5 seconds minimum between calls
    canCall: function() {
      const now = Date.now();
      if (now - this.lastCall < this.minInterval) return false;
      this.lastCall = now;
      return true;
    }
  };
  ```

### 6. **No HTTPS Enforcement for API Calls**
- **Location:** DataService.js
- **Risk:** While GitHub Pages uses HTTPS, the code doesn't enforce it
- **Solution:** Validate URL protocol:
  ```javascript
  if (!url.startsWith('https://')) {
    throw new Error('Only HTTPS connections allowed');
  }
  ```

### 7. **Location Permission Not Validated**
- **Location:** MapScreen.js
- **Risk:** App doesn't check if location permission is granted
- **Solution:** Add permission checks before using location

---

## 🟢 GOOD PRACTICES OBSERVED

### Positive Security Measures:
1. ✅ **No database credentials** - Uses static data via GitHub Pages
2. ✅ **Proper error handling** - Try-catch blocks throughout
3. ✅ **Data caching** - Reduces API calls and improves offline experience
4. ✅ **Timeout controls** - 10-second timeout on fetch requests
5. ✅ **Retry logic with exponential backoff** - Prevents request flooding
6. ✅ **Memory leak prevention** - Cleanup in useEffect hooks
7. ✅ **Content Security** - NSAllowsArbitraryLoads set to false in iOS

---

## 📊 PERFORMANCE OBSERVATIONS

### Strengths:
- ✅ Memoized components reduce re-renders
- ✅ Proper cleanup of intervals and subscriptions
- ✅ Efficient data structure with minimal nesting
- ✅ Lazy loading of community data

### Areas for Improvement:
- ⚠️ Large number of Circle overlays could impact performance
- ⚠️ Consider implementing marker clustering for many fires
- ⚠️ Add image optimization for future icon assets

---

## 🔒 PRIVACY & COMPLIANCE

### Current Status:
- ✅ No personal data collection
- ✅ No analytics or tracking
- ✅ Clear location permission description
- ✅ Data sourced from public government APIs

### Recommendations:
- Add privacy policy before App Store/Play Store submission
- Document data retention policies
- Add user consent for location access

---

## 📝 RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### Immediate (Before Production):
1. **Remove/rotate exposed Google Maps API key**
2. **Implement API key management via environment variables**
3. **Sanitize file paths in metadata**
4. **Add coordinate validation**
5. **Fix hardcoded Git path**

### Short-term:
1. Implement rate limiting
2. Add HTTPS enforcement
3. Add location permission validation
4. Implement marker clustering for performance
5. Add input sanitization for all external data

### Long-term:
1. Add automated security scanning to CI/CD
2. Implement API monitoring and alerting
3. Add comprehensive logging (without sensitive data)
4. Consider implementing certificate pinning for API calls
5. Add app attestation/integrity checks

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Rotate and secure Google Maps API key
- [ ] Remove all console.log statements in production build
- [ ] Enable ProGuard/R8 for Android release builds
- [ ] Test on multiple devices and network conditions
- [ ] Verify all permissions are necessary and documented
- [ ] Add crash reporting (e.g., Sentry, Crashlytics)
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries in React
- [ ] Add app version checking and force update mechanism
- [ ] Review and update all dependencies for security patches

---

## CONCLUSION

The NL Wildfire Tracker is well-architected with good separation of concerns and proper error handling. The main security concern is the exposed API key which must be addressed immediately. After resolving the critical issues and implementing the recommended security measures, the application will be ready for safe production deployment.

**Risk Level:** MODERATE (HIGH if API key not rotated)
**Production Ready:** NO - Critical issues must be resolved first
